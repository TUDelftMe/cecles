TIME: ca. 3,5min

Welcome everyone to the presentation of group 6

In the past few weeks, we built a prototype of CECLES - the Collaborative Enriched Course Learning Experience System 

I, Stephan, will cover the first part on the thoughts that created CECLES
Jeroen will present to you the ideas and progress of CECLES and the human computation component
Sjoerd will present more of the IR techniques we've built in called pipelines
and Finally, Martin will run you all though a live demo of our system (fingers crossed)


WHY CECLES

CECLES is a system for students to collect study material 

* quickly 
* without disctraction
* and only the most relevant material

why do you need this? Allow to walk me through your typical studying experience: 

you have you lecture notes, the material on blackboard and the recorded classes on collegerama

Then you go look for more, search through Wikipedia - spend time searching - you look for videos on youtube and all of a sudden Reddit is open. How did that happen?

So the broad idea comes together:
1. extract data from TU delft courses
2. personalize this for student groups
3. the system does the searches for you

And here's one of the mockups for the idea
